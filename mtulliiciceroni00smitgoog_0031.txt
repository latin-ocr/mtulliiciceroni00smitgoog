⁴ The Greek eloquence was more simple, uniform, and sumai, than'
the Roman, and, consequentiy‚ did not require all the amilianes, which ,
Ciceqo demands in an orator. In giving his opinion, that the authority
of those of his countrymen, whom all Rome allowed to be tinished orators,
was t0 be preferred to thot of tha Greeks, he manifesta a strong attach·
ment to his favorite system, and a degree of national pride.

i Every one may perceive the propriety and beauty with which Cicero
>introduces the following dialogue, in the three important circumstances of
time, place, and characters. The time is, when the cause of the nobility
⁸ was on the point of minhy an overhearingConsul, who ought to haue been ¹

:their patron anddelender. The place 'is Tusculanmn, a very pleasant
retreat, ata small distance from Rome. The persons engagedis the

conference are Crassus, Antonius, Mutius Scaevola, Cotta, and Sulpitius:

of whom the two first were distinguished orators; Scaevola was one of the

greatest lawyers of the age, and Cotta and sulpitius, young gentlemen of

high rank, and very promisingappearanoe.

He introdoeetl those illustriora perseriages as acting theitparts in the
dialogm that he might wipe off the imputation of eloquente being taught
at Rome, by men of no quality. .

Cicero, by treating his subject in a dialogue, has avoided the dogmatical
air, which, otherwise, his discussion of it must have given him· erasas

’ «cumeum Cicero's sentiments, with regard to eloquence. . R
