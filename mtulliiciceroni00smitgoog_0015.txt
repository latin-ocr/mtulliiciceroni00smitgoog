tamem Cicero ipprett and mexpectedcalemity. Clodiae
had an intrigue with Pompeia, Casar'swife, who, according
to annual orimum, wau then celebrating in her house those
awful sacrifices of the goddess, to „which nd moleiras etet
admitted. The thought of gaining acccsa to his mistress,
in the midat'of her solemn ministry, flattered the ranity of
Clodius. To effect his purpose, he dressed himself iu a
.- woman’shabit ; hoping that, by the advantage olhis smooth
face, aud the introduction of one ot'the maida, he might pata
without discovery. 'By some mistake, however, between
him and hia gulde, he lost his way, when became within the
house,and was detected. Tha story was immediately spread
abroad, and cxcited general horrorthroughout the , city.
When Clodius, by order of the senate, was brought to trial,
he produced two witnesees rhourore that, when it was eain
he, committed this impiety, he, was, at Interamna, two or
r three days journey from the city. Βμῐ Cicero, heing, called
·2hartnittetta-,tata{titutumtt
when the mysterieslol the Bona Dea were polluted.
Irritamd hythis, Clodius meditated revenge· It was his
wtsh'to he chonen T ribuue, and in that office to drive Cicero
outof the city, by the sanction of a law, which he hoped by
tome artifice or other to obtrude upon the people. . ω ,
· As no patriciae was capable of the tribunate hy its original
,- institution, his hrot aun was to become a plebeiae, by an
adoption into apleheiau family. T his he effected by the
suffragca of the people: , ,
The hrst triumvirate was now formed, which was awick·
ed conspiracy of three ofthe most powerful citizens of Rome,
to extort from theircountry by violence, what they could not
¹ obtain by law. Pompey’s chief motiva was to procurethe

· confirmation of his acts by Cacsar in his consulship, the ·

timeopf'which'was now approachiog.‘ Cesar hoped, by >giv-

ὑ jug way to Pompey’e glory, to advance his own. It was the

aim of Craesus to gain that ascendancy hy the authority of

Pompey and Cesar, which he could not otherwise acquire.

. Cicero might have made what terma he 5 pleased with this
triumvirate. He might have been admitted a partnerof their

''powen‘anda fourth in their league. Bothe would not en·

J ''all'thc friends ol'the libertiea of Rome abhorred.
